# Data Science Assignment 

Have made a detailed comparison among the performance of the **Three Big Khans** of Bollywood on the Box Office for the last **30 years**.

Major libraries used are numpy, pandas and matplotlib. 

Took the data from [bollywoodhungama.com](https://www.bollywoodhungama.com)

## Directory Structure

- **Data** - contains the data on the actors in the format of a csv file. 

- **Plots** - contains the graphs made using the aforementioned python libraries. 

- **Final_Report** - contains the final report in pdf format with all the analysis and the inferences I made from the graphs. 

Rest are 
- 5 python scripts, each creates different types of plots and saves them in the **Plots** directory, and 
- one bash script to run all the python scripts.
